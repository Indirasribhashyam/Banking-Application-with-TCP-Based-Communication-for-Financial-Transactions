# Banking-Application-with-TCP-Based-Communication-for-Financial-Transactions
The Financial Systems and Banking Software project is aimed at developing a secure and robust application for processing transactions, managing account data, and ensuring reliable communication between financial institutions.



## Project Description

The application will leverage transport protocols, specifically TCP, to provide reliable, high-performance, and secure data transfer across the banking network. The design focuses on creating a stable environment for high-stakes data transfer, ensuring compliance with security standards, and optimizing transaction handling.This system will encompass critical features such as transaction processing, data security, and error handling. Financial transactions will be managed efficiently with precise data integrity checks, utilizing encryption techniques to protect sensitive information. The banking software will connect with external financial entities via secure protocols, facilitating the exchange of data such as payment requests, account updates, and fund transfers.
